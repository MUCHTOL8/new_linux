> dv2: How to journal so you it's helpful and pleasureable to read.

Practice writing about world events, life events, day to day events, your thoughts on things, and if you dare, your feelings on things. 
Then practice rewriting what you've written to see what is good reading.
If you aren't sure what you want to write about then start writing about what you think you might want to write about it. Journal your thoughts on things you might want to write about.

Your character also might not take the time to fully describe people or places. Why would she bother to describe to her diary her mother’s appearance, or what her bedroom looks like?

One idea is to write short blurbs of what happened (the important bits) each day and then once a week or so to sit down and add commentary on what you thought was most important for the week.

A diary is a sort of review of the past. Looking through and processing what has happened (whether recently or the more distant past). A process for sorting out what is of value would be good. Typically a story needs to revolve around the plot and leave out the details but it can be difficult to know what the plot is. Perhaps the plot is an ever evolving plot and what the plot is today is only what our goals are today, and will make for a story as the person watches epiphanies and discoveries happen week by week. 
A diary seems like it must have some use. Is it to record events for future use? Is it to put your thoughts to paper so as to figure out your feels, goals, and direction? Is it simply to entertain (certainly not). Can you mix the things? If so you must certainly have it clearly deliniated when and where you will write with one purpose over the other, or so I would think.

Using the Markdown markings in your journal would help keep things bullet. Use different colors for the different symbols # > - ''. 
Remember to think about things as if you were explaining the importance of the things. You can keep your technical notes elsewhere. Only include enough details or diagrams to explain that. It would also be good to add a page here and there to show your financials (debts, bills, income, investments) as that will show an aspect of your life in itself and give a sort of depth to everything else. Don't bother being too proper. You can always add full names in later of books, people, etc. 

We are still faced with, what is the point. Do you simple just not want to forget some things over the years? or are you wanting to clarify things in your own head at the moment. or to make connections from tracking events over a longer term view? add in some note-to-selfs would be good too, instead of writing down all of your grand ideas that you haven't fleshed out or fully understood you can just put a reminder to do so and what you hope will be gained by studying and fleshing out those ideas. 

Don't forget to add scenes and dialogue.
EXAMPLE:
"Oh my god, I HATE Linda right now. She is being such a BITCH!!!!!! She told EVERYBODY at the bus stop I wasn’t wearing deodorant, and they all laughed at me and called me a stinky pig. I’m seriously not talking to her anymore. She SUUUUCKS and is officially no longer my friend!!!!!!!!"

First of all, I don’t think I’d want to read a whole book like this, riddled with excessive explanation points and all-caps.  Secondly, in most books, this would be a scene, right? We’d be at the bus stop with Linda and the protagonist. We’d get a little description of the other kids. We’d get the dialogue of what was said. We’d be SHOWN the bitchiness of Linda instead of being TOLD about it. Although it’s fine to have some telling in a diary novel, you really have to include scenes and dialogue.

Another BETTER EXAMPLE:
“I’ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy.”


Questions: Who did you talk to that day? What were your obligations?maybe?? What were your goals to accomplish that day? What did you read or study? What did you do with steph? How did the things you do move you towards your goal? How was your 1. direction 2. effort 3. persistence? What is your strategy? What were  situational constraints you faced? What was the task complexity? What are your proximal goals? Imagine the details of the process required to attain a good mark.




Writing Benefits
Careful writing about traumatic or uncertain events, past, present or future, appears to produce a variety of benefits, physiological and psychological. Written accounts of trauma positively influence health.
Participants are asked to describea traumatic personal eventin writing (or, in the control condition, to write about a trivial topic), during 15 to 30 minute sessions. These sessions range in frequency,from a single instance to multiple sittings,spread out over a numberof weeks. During each session, individuals are instructed to write continually for the allotted time, without regard for grammar or spelling


The Writing Assignment That Changes Lives
Why do you do what you do? What is the engine that keeps you up late at night or gets you going in the morning? Where is your happy place? What stands between you and your ultimate dream? NPR's feature on the Self Authoring Suite.

You should number your jounral pages. 
Create an index in the front of it (2 pages). 
Beginning your journaling at the front and leave out anything technical. 
Explain it like you would to Steph and show her the importance of what you are doing not the how and the what. 
Then pick a page in the back 3rd of the book and start writing the technical parts. 

You should also include a monthly picture of your finances that take up a single page, add them to the index. 
Your financial page should include some other markers such as your weight (basically things you cna put digits to or are solid like goals) and goals.
Be sure to make a clear picture of what you are striving for and the process of attaining that from the end to the beginning.
THINGS THAT ARE DONE REPEATEDLY SHOULD HAVE A SHORTHAND VERSION (things like earning money or spending money, awaking, laying down, falling asleep, eating, bathroom, getting dressed, things you can't live without doing) AND THE SYMBOLS OR SHORTHAND SHOULD BE INTUITIVE (no explanation necessary); The short hand is for the chronological accounting of the day you'll write before you write your journal. It shouldn't be used in the actual journal unless it's actually the type of event that is note worthy and maybe not even then.

Symbol Ledgend:
# - Chronology
Goals and Monies should be in the same section.
** - Goals (not the how, just the why it's important and the why you think it must be done with some history??)
> - Monies and money goals.
=+ - Musings
+ - Special Event You Wouldn't Normally Write About.
X - Sorting out your feelings
<> - The Meat

You should have a page that talks about your goals and desires, probably at the beginning and you can comment on it as you go.

A good technical page(s) to have would be "compliments that steph uses" especially ones that she uses on you or ones that she tells you to use on her (which she does on some rare occasions). Writing down the things about her that you love or that are great or the list of ways that you tell her that she is better than other girls. BE SURE TO ADD A SHORT DATE BEFORE EACH ENTRY ex. 10/5 
You don't need to add a full date as you will be adding what day you are starting the journal on at the front of the jounral and then you will add the date you finish the journal, like 10/5/2019 - 9/6/2021


It seems that you are trying to keep your musings and the mundane day-to-day activities out of your journal.


Tension is the heart of every good story.
14. There is tension in every area of your life. With every desire there are roadblocks and time constraints. There are constant relationship problems. There are bills to be paid. Bosses to be appeased who are making your life difficult. Talk about your health problems and how they are keeping you back.

Typing it up would be best and then rewriting the sentences to be something that is more concise and flows better. It would probably be better to practice on someone else's writing or you may not get anything written down on paper.

13. Things kvothe talks about: his lute, how much money he has and where it goes and where and when he gets more; his pains; his clothes; his travels (the why for traveling and the preperations); his projects/creations; his studies (good books and bad books; his girl; his feuds/enemies; interactions with his friends but not details of their life; Things he wants but can't have right then; how his past affects him now (thick feet help him; danger sense; lack of money; fears;). He includeds how you'd think he would be or how you think something would have affected him or how you'd think he'd be different because of this or that. 

You may want to be able to add in a couple of Special areas; Special Events, and Musings. The Special Event could be something that happened that you want to mention but isn't something you'd normally write about, just sort of a one time thing. The Musings are for times when you just want to put your thoughts on down/ empty your brain onto paper so you can forget it until a later date like dumbeldore's pensive.


11. Be sure to show it not tell it on things that you can. The weather, the small apartment, 
Examples: I was covered in sweat before we even got to the store. I let Steph borrow my hat to protect her delicate skin. 

food
10. communications (even unanswered ones) but not peple you speak with often unless it is significant or special and relates to something else on the list.
arisal
laying down
sleep
9.Purchases
1.Gifts (given or recieved)
2. property destroyed (your shirt, someone else's car)
3. books read that relate to your goals
4. events/achievements that open up new doors/free up time/take up time.
5. people that have what you want and your efforts to be friend them (and what it is they have that you want of course).
6. The people you are traveling with during your travels.
7. Mention what activity you did with people.
8. Dont' mention every activity you do (playing your lute everyday). You can mention an activity that you are supposed to do everyday (or frequently) only on a bi-weekly bases if you've been consistent OR when you've had some success with it, however long that may be (weeks, months, longer).

MUSINGS (AKA MUNDANE)
For times when you just want to put your thoughts on down/ empty your brain onto paper so you can forget it until a later date like dumbeldores's pensive.

SPECIAL EVENTS

TECHNICAL PAGES
This section is where you will put the things you've learned (lessons), your notes on subjects but not the detailed notes that belong in a NOTE book. Mostly this is like a list of things you should act on or improve on or that you think you might want to improve on. A list of books you should look into or excellent websites you should look into. Diagrams, Mind Maps, etc to help show are ok. Keep this section small (as small as possible).

GOALS
This is the meat of your goals and the purpose of this section is to writedown what new goals arise as you run into obstacles while persuing the goals from previous days.
This isn't just a list of goals is they WHY you desire that goal (what findings and experiences brought you to desire it) and WHY you feel you must go about it in a certain way. Your thought process of calculations, decisions, and eliminations of paths. Essentially this is the place for you to eexplain your goals to a bystander.

CHRONOLOGY
This section is for you to keep track of how you spend your time AND to use as a framework when writing the rest of the day. A memory prode.
If you don't know the actual hours just take a guess.
Start with the easy stuff.
Before writing the a journal entry write the day chronologically.
Round to the nearest quarter hour.
Don't be too picky or too detailed. It's just to give you an idea of what you did that day that you can look back at and a reference sheet to help you rememeber all that you experienced that day.

State where the action took place unless it was at home, then don't specify.

SORTING OUT YOUR FEELINGS
Write down your feelings, write why you feel that way about them and what you think you should do about them and then just keep writing until you are certain you understand how you feel. 
Feeling overwhelmed in life will likely be a good common topic.

MUSINGS (AKA MUNDANE)
For times when you just want to put your thoughts on down/ empty your brain onto paper so you can forget it until a later date like dumbeldore's pensive.
This section gives you a place to write your random thoughts that are too boring, but you feel you need to put it somewhere.
