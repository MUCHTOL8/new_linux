Overnight Oats:

The powder sticking to the side is a major pain. You may want to consider either:
1.) Mixing all of the ingredients in a large bowl and then proportioning them into the jars.
2.) Pre-blending the chocolate, the milk, and the yogurt in the blender (but it will probably stick to the sides of the blender too but that would still be easier than dealing with the sides of 7 jars.)
Otherwise.) Use a knife to scrape the sides of the jar and mix the contents.

The order in which you put the ingredients into the jars is important. The wrong order means things won't fit.
