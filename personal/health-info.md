Bread Machine Recipe.
All-purpose flour/liquid ratio is: 2 & 1/2 to 3 cups flour to 1 & 1/4 cups liquid, depending on the time of year -- more flour in the summer, less in the winter.
2:1 bread:liquid
1/2 teaspoon salt per cup of flour.
1/2 teaspoon yeast per cup of flour.
 
 Too little yeast, your bread won't rise sufficiently; too much, and it will rise and collapse.
 Yeast likes an acidic environment. Although the fermentation process naturally creates an acidic environment, to make yeast even happier, increase the dough’s acidity a bit. You can do this by adding a pinch of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or by replacing some of the liquid with an acidic liquid (a tablespoon of orange juice, lemon juice or vinegar). This is especially helpful when you’re following a sweet bread recipe, one in which the yeast will be slowed down by a larger amount of sugar.
 the longer the rise (and fermentation process), the better the flavor.

============================ Sleep ==================================
=====================================================================
The key to sleeping well is to:
sleep less (less that 8 hours, probably 7 or 6)
spring out of bed (this becomes part of your "pattern")
have a consistent sleep pattern (9pm - 5am)
temperature change (use a OOler pad (chilipad) to have a temperature drop)
electric temperature gauge for house (to have a sudden temperature drop)
wool (or another breathable cloth for blankets)
mattress that is breathable (so your body can lower it's temperature and raise it at the appropriate times) 
eye mask (to block out sleep)
flushing out beta-ameloid protein (slow wave sleep)
tracking sleep quality (with the OURA ring)
take melatonin (when you are stressed or have been knocked off your schedule)
grounding (camping?) 
socialize (during the day)
exercise (several times a week)
valerian root
lavender and chamomile (oil on pillow, herbal tincture, oil diffused)
bedtime story (one that is engaging and you've never heard/seen before)
don't eat for at least 2 hours before bed
take fiber (keeps you from being bloated and therefore having to pee often)

nature makes ample use of atmospheric electricity (positie ions must be taken into account not just negative ones)
sit near waterfalls (negative ions are orders of magnitude more abundant due to small aerosol negative ions that exists only for a few seconds)
be in or near a sea shore or the ocean (the lenard effect, water agitation creates negative ions in proportion to the amount of agitation)
be outside as much as possible (negative ions in the air are nearly absent in buildings and are greatly reduced in uran areas)
open the window (air conditioning is a major reducer of negative ions, as well as other electronic equipment, and to a lesser degree synthetics)
avoid sitting in operating vehicles (almost no negative ions and a goodly amount of positive ones)
avoid being outside before a storm (thunderstorm?, postive ions are orders of magnitude more abundant than any time or place else)
avoid places with little tree coverage (even if it is a natural setting)
atmospheric ionizer (get one that doesn't produce ozone and one doesn't have air filters)
80 to 85 percent of ionic particles enter the body through the skin and the remaining 15 to 20 percent through respiration.
spend time in mountain forest areas

========== The Secret Therapy of Trees - Marco Mencagli =============
=====================================================================
Everybody knows that humans can survive for a while without food
and water, but we cannot live a single moment without the energy supply of
the sun. We receive electromagnetic radiation in various wavelengths from
the sun, particularly light and infrared, which nourish and enable life on
Earth, warming us and enabling plants to produce oxygen and organic
material through photosynthesis. The sun also creates a powerful magnetic
field, which in turn conditions the geomagnetic field of the Earth and itsfluctuations. Then factor in the effects of the gravitation of celestial bodies
and the enormous rotation of our galaxy.
Like the inside of a giant watch, the energies of the cosmos create
rhythms and pulsations in living and nonliving materials. In the third
century BC Greek botanist Theophrastus suggested cutting wood at the start
of the waning moon in order to obtain a more durable material. The
effectiveness of this practice has recently been proven by a study carried out
at the University of Zurich.
In the 1950s Giorgio Piccardi observed, through thousands of
experiments repeated around the world, that the energetic influence of the
sun and the cycle of seasons changed chemical reactions and the
precipitation of compounds. This compelled other researchers to verify
similar fluctuations in human and botanical behavior.
These phenomena are made possible by various manifestations of
electromagnetic forces that are at the base of the structure of matter. We
could also think of them as the fundamental biological language that nature
uses to allow each element, from the atoms that make up the material to the
more complex structures of living beings, to interact and instantaneously
transmit the information that regulates vital processes.
Everything vibrates, and does so with specific characteristics and
objectives. In a now famous quote, Nikola Tesla stated, “If you want to
understand the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency
and vibration.”
Immersed in this pulsating ocean, living beings have developed
remarkable sensitivities to electromagnetic waves. It is a phenomenon that
is evident in many animal species: sharks, rays, and catfish, for example,
are able to sense and respond to extremely weak intensities of electric fields
in order to find food over long distances. As for humans, pronounced
physical reactions have been observed in some hypersensitive people when
they are exposed to very weak intensities of certain electromagnetic
frequencies. Biological sensitivity applies to all living beings to varying
extents. It’s as if we are able to tune in to an almost imperceptible radio
signal, while avoiding the interferences of nearby stations. This selectivity
is a good thing, because to be sensitive to all the fields of energy in which
we are immersed would be rather overwhelming.In this way, the cells of human beings are comparable to small celestial
bodies: they give off and receive a large quantity of signals such as radio
waves, microwaves, and visible and invisible light waves, as well as
infrasound, which all communicate necessary vital information. Carlo
Ventura, a biology professor at the University of Bologna who conducts
innovative research on stem cells, explains: “We have become aware that
cells are capable of emitting electromagnetic fields and nanomechanical
vibrations. This has led us to discover that exposure to radio electric fields
can ‘reprogram’ even non-stem adult human cells, such as dermal
fibroblasts, into types of cells they would not otherwise transform into, such
as cardiovascular, neuronal, and muscular cells. These results show that the
destiny of stem cells can be noticeably altered by physical energy.”
All of the above means that, in our environment, life is closely
connected to electromagnetism, and this phenomenon can act directly—and
selectively—on how humans, animals, and plants function.The Living Organism as Biological Antenna
In 1960, Walter Kunnen founded Archibo Biologica in Antwerp, Belgium,
the first research center to specialize in the influences of the biosphere on
living things and the study of bioenergetics. Kunnen was a tenacious
scholar who thought outside the box. This was, perhaps, how he succeeded
in developing a decisively original research method that was surprisingly
precise in evaluating the quality of the environment and measuring the
effects that it produces on the various functions of living organisms.
He started off by thoroughly investigating the practical applications of
bioresonance, a field based on the theory that every substance oscillates
principally on its own specific frequency. In the 1950s, this discipline saw
its first practical applications in the field of medicine. Kunnen’s interest in
biology led him to demonstrate that every group or collection of cells with
the same function, liver cells for example, resonates on precise
electromagnetic frequencies, allowing the organs to gather the energy they
need to survive. This principle is identical to that of an antenna that receivesor sends a certain electromagnetic signal. When this “antenna function” is
interrupted, the body ceases to live. In living beings, we can also observe
examples of organs or systems with an antenna function: in animals the eye
carries out this magnificent task, converting light radiation into electrical
stimuli for the brain, and in green leaves chloroplasts absorb light and
activate the process of photosynthesis.
Kunnen wanted to understand the effects on living beings of being
constantly immersed in a biosphere full of electromagnetic signals on all
frequencies, and how to distinguish the useful and harmful information
these signals offer us. This was a feasible operation, but it depended on a
new comprehension of energy phenomena in biology, as well as an
adequate measuring instrument.
Cellular Nutrition and Health
Electromagnetism is a phenomenon well studied by physicists, but even
today science finds its limits in the biological interpretation of phenomena
like electricity, magnetism, and gravity, even if their mechanical effects can
be measured and predicted. For example, it is still difficult to establish
precisely which effects are produced in our bodies when we are exposed to
one of the many sources of electrosmog, such as cell phone towers or high-
voltage power lines. In light of this, Kunnen proposed a different vision of
electromagnetism, certainly outside the conventional box, but very
functional in terms of biology. This understanding will help us understand
the mechanisms through which we can study our interaction with plants.
According to Kunnen’s experiment, what is usually called an
electromagnetic wave is actually made up of a pair of spirals that move
forward in space intertwined together. One rotates to the right (clockwise
rotation with positive polarity) and the other to the left (counterclockwise
rotation with negative polarity). These fields transport information within
the biosphere and at the same time give energy to living beings as carrier
waves and carried waves. The carrier waves emitted by a radio station, for
example, are the radio signal that transports in space the varioustransmissions (the information, or carried waves) that we receive when we
listen. In the same way, in nature there are carrying and carried waves that,
as we will see later on, are of fundamental biological importance.
Carrier waves are signals that move through space in a straight line,
have neutral or balanced polarity (because the positive and negative spirals
they are composed of are of the same intensity), and act as vectors or
“modes of transport” in space for carried waves, which are electromagnetic
fields with frequencies that resonate and interact with the various organs of
the human body. These are often “unbalanced,” because their spirals of
positive and negative polarity are of different intensities, which are
conditioned by many factors. And it is this characteristic that determines the
diverse information—beneficial or harmful—sent to cells. But why is
polarity so important in biology?
To explain, Kunnen proposed an energetic representation of the cell,
which can help us understand how it is nourished both in terms of chemistry
and electromagnetism. His measurements showed him that the healthy cell,
if examined in its own natural environment, is a dynamic structure that
tends to maintain a predominantly negative charge on the surface of the
membrane, while the inside (called cellular light) is predominantly positive,
unlike what is assumed in biology. Since we know that opposite magnetic
poles attract and like poles repel, according to this model the healthy cell is
nourished by principally attracting useful substances that promote a positive
polarity. The cell does not live in a static magnetic field, but emits its own
specific frequency and other electromagnetic signals that enter into
resonance with nourishing elements. This allows it to dynamically attract
and modulate its nutrition through a phenomenon that we could therefore
call electromagnetic osmosis.
For the same reason, if a cell is hit by an electromagnetic field with
which it enters into resonance (carried wave) and which has a greater
intensity on its negative polarity, the cellular membrane inverts its own
external charge through magnetic repulsion and loses its polarity, which
damages the cell.
Exposure to fields that have greater intensities on positive polarity tend
to play a rebalancing or even therapeutic role, reinforcing the correct
functionality and health of the cell, since opposite poles attract.Kunnen’s cellular energetic model plays a fundamental role in our
understanding of the biological significance of electromagnetism and its
implications for daily life. But his investigations of the biosphere and subtle
electromagnetic mechanisms wouldn’t have been possible without a simple
instrument invented in the 1950s.
The Lecher Antenna
The Lecher antenna, named in homage to the Austrian engineer Ernst
Lecher and invented by German physicist Reinhard Schneider, was
designed to accurately measure electromagnetic wavelengths and
frequencies of biological interest, without adding any energies or distorting
the measured signal.
This instrument allows the user to select a desired frequency to receive
a signal (just like on a regular radio) whose sensitivity is part of the
microwave field. By following a precise measurement technique, it is
possible to amplify the vibration or electromagnetic resonance of the
antenna to the sensitive biological structure of the human organism. The
antenna used by Kunnen and his collaborators is an enhanced version of
Schneider’s, and allows the user to take highly detailed measurements of
the intensity of the electromagnetic fields at each of its two polarities. This
is extremely important, because it is the variable that defines the biological
quality of the signals the cell encounters. Practical experiments have indeed
demonstrated that cellular health requires a well-defined and even
relationship between these intensities, with a slight predominance of the
dextrorotatory component (positive polarity). On the other hand we could
have aggressive signals, or signals too weak to carry energetic nourishment,
or therapeutic signals, as in the case of a strong dextrorotatory
predominance.
The Lecher antenna, if used correctly, is still the most simple, versatile,
and sophisticated biological measuring system. Its practicality lies in the
fact that it does not need software or an electronic circuit to function, but
only the correct and precise training of the operator to react to theelectromagnetic microimpulses provoked by contact with the antenna. This
equipment allows us to carry out analysis on the energetic state of various
human organs in a short time. It also allows us to measure its reactions to
environmental influences and verify the existence of electromagnetic fields
in nature that are extremely weak but of extremely high biological affinity.
