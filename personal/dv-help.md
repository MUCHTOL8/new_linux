- dv-help: To Be Created: A reminder list of notes you wish created.

`tldr tbc-info`

All the files you've created (except this one) fall into 1 of 3 categories. They end in:
1) dv{{#}}.md     # A table of contents for a category of notes: 0 through 9
2) -info.md       # Extensive guides that aim to be comprehensive guides
3) -short.md      # For sweet and short versions of -info.md
This is to keep your notes seperate from tldr files for backup purposes.

- Examples of what markdown works with tldr.
