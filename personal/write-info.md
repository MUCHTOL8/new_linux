#How to write so as to capture a thing concisely and fully

> A guide to writing

- There is a difference between the meaning and the significance of a word or phrase. "The Storm is coming" can be translated to another langauge with the same meaning but the significance may be lost depending on the hearer/reader.

It would seem to me that idioms carry a built in meaning that is agreed upon by everyone, and the significance is will likely be closer for everyone as well.





‘Equivalent  in  terms  of  the  code’:  this  needs  explanation.  Linguisticphenomena  may  be  equivalent  in  the  sense  that  at  one  level  of  codingthey  may  be  different,  but  at  another  level  they  may  be  the  same.  It  is  thepossibility  of  such  many–one  codings  that  justifies  a  multilevel  model  oflanguage in the first place. To take some simple lexical examples: judgmentand judgment are  two  orthographic  encodings,  or  variants,  of  the  same(syntactic-level) word; often and frequently are two syntactic-level encodingsof  the  same  meaning  (which  is  what  we  mean  when  we  say  they  are‘synonyms’).  In  the  decoding  direction,  hard has  at  least  two  senses:  onewhich is the opposite of ‘easy’, and another which is the opposite of ‘soft’ –in  other  words,  hard is  ambiguous  or  polysemous.  Again,  the  sequenceof  letters  s, a and w  represents  two  different  words,  one  a  noun  and  theother  a  verb  which  is  the  past  tense  form  of  see.Although  stylistics  ischiefly interested in encoding variants, it is in the nature of language, as amulticoding  system,  that  the  many–one  mappings  go  in  both  directions:

deictics



- ‘semantic variants’ or ‘variant conceptualisa-tions’ because they involve differences of meaning, however slight.



In prose writing, the discrepancy between identity of meaning and iden-tity of sense is well exemplified in the device of so-called elegant variation:we have already noted, for instance (see p. 85), Henry James’s use of non-synonymous  expressions:  ‘the  poor  young  man’,  ‘this  personage’,  etc.,  asways  of  referring  to  the  same  person.


esterday,for  example,means  ‘the  day  before  today’  on  every  occasion  of  its  use.  However,  ifuttered  on  25th  June,  it  refers  to  24th  June,  but  if  uttered  on  30th  June,it  refers  to  29th  June.  It  belongs  to  the  class  of  items  (deictics,  see  sec-tion  10.1.1)  which  vary  systematically,  in  their  reference,  according  to  thesituation  in  which  they  are  uttered.  Consider  the  two  sentences:[1]  John Smith’s birthday was on the twenty-fourth of June.[2]  Yesterday was my birthday.Although  these  sentences  differ  in  sense,  it  is  quite  possible  for  them  tohave the same reference, and the same truth value.


From the linguistic point of view (and this is one way in which linguisticsdiffers from philosophy) it is more profitable to apply terms like ‘truth’ and‘reference’  to  psychological  realities:  one  is  not  interested  in  what  is  reallythe  case,  but  what  particular  individuals  know  or  believe to  be  the  case.


.  How  we  haveacquired this model of reality need not concern us, nor need the complex-ities of its structure. It will be sufficient to regard it as the starting point andfinishing point of communication in an informational sense. That is, whenwe inform someone by means of language we retrieve a message from ourmodel  of  reality  and  by  means  of  the  encoding  and  decoding  of  languagetransfer  it  to  the  addressee,  who  then  fits  it  into  his  own  model  of  reality.From  this  it  is  easy  to  go  one  step  further  and  to  say  that  the  same  thinghappens  in  fictional  discourse,  except  that  it  is  a  postulated  or  imaginedmodel  of  reality  –  in  short,  a  fiction  –  that  is  transferred  to  the  addressee.

The action and the words spoken often don't convey the meaning or the significance. You must describe the person's meaning or the words/actions significance.


atherineMansfield  describes  the  noise  made  by  the  door  as  a  click.  From  the  factthat a click (as opposed to a bang, for example) is a soft, unresonant (thoughabrupt) noise, we are able to conclude that the door was shut without greatforce.  From  this  again,  if  we  read  with  an  eye  to  the  preceding  context,we  can  draw  further  conclusions  of  a  social  nature.  We  are  not  told  so,but  surely  we  must  surmise  that  the  door  was  shut  unobtrusively,  andtherefore  gently,  by  the  shopkeeper.  In  this  shrine  of  opulence,  deferenceto  one’s  customer  requires  that  a  shopkeeper  should  not  appear  to  talk  ofprice  (‘a  murmur  reached  her ’),  nor  treat  his  goods  as  merchandise  (‘Hewould be willing . . . to keep it . . . for ever’), nor should he appear to shutthe door on his customer. The adjective discreet (which, notice, is applied tothe door rather than to the man) strengthens this inference from the ‘click’


11]  The  door  discreetly  shut  with  a  click.By  changing  the  adjective  discreet into  an  adverb,  this  would  have  lostsome  of  the  force  of  the  original,  which  attributes  the  behavioural  qualityof discretion metonymically to the door, an inanimate object which cannot,in literal actuality, possess it. The author makes it seem as if in this euphe-mistic  world,  tradesmen,  dealers  –  men  of  the  flesh  –  have  refined  them-selves out of existence, and have imparted their qualities to the shop itself,its  furniture  and  fittings,  in  a  general  ambience  of  discretion.


In  [10],  the  intransitive  verb  shut is  replaced  by  the  passive  was  shut,which  tells  us  that  there  is  an  implicit  agent,  a  doer  of  the  action.  Thissentence  is  therefore  more  specific  than  [3],  and  cannot  be  regarded  asentirely  equivalent  in  sense.  It  excludes  the  interpretation  that  the  doorshut  of  its  own  accord,  and  so  leads  more  explicitly  to  the  conclusion  thatthe door was shut by the shopman. But in any case, this is a likely inferencefrom  [3],  so  again  the  sentences  are  referentially  virtually  equivalent.  Itseems  that  the  author  has  deliberately  left  things  vague  by  choosing  theintransitive  verb  construction;  that  she  wants  us  to  have  the  delicatelyironic  impression  of  a  deferential,  high-class  shop  in  which  doors,  as  itwere,  open  and  shut  almost  of  their  own  accord.  This  is  the  world  of  self-effacing service in which the heroine moves with assurance: even if servitorsare visible, it is not for her to notice them. That this is a likely interpretationis supported by the negative evidence of another variant:


- The  syntactic  level


[3]  The  discreet  door  shut  with  a  click.
[12]  With  a  click  the  discreet  door  shut.
[13]  The  discreet  door  clicked  shut.

Unlike  [9],  these  sentences  do  not  treat  the  two  events  of  shutting  andclicking as separate things: in this respect, as in other respects, [12] and [13]are just different ways of expressing the same sense as [3]. But again thereare  differences  of  effect.  In  [12],  the  adverbial  with  a  click  is  placed  beforethe  rest  of  the  sentence,  perversely  making  us  aware  of  the  ‘click’  beforethe  ‘shutting’  which  caused  it  (see  section  7.7.1).  In  [13],  the  change  ofsyntactic  form,  although  it  makes  the  sentence  more  concise,  has  phono-logical  consequences  which  appear  to  be  undesirable.  To  see  this,  we  firsthave to note that the original sentence [3] has a phonological aptness to itsmeaning.  The  word  click isonomatopoeic  in  itself,  and  the  neat,  abruptquality  of  the  sound  it  signifies  is  echoed  in  the  final  /t/  consonance  ofdiscreet and shut,  and  by  the  initial  /d/  alliteration  of  discreet and door.In[13] this effect is accentuated because of the succession of stressed syllables(‘-créet  dóor  clícked  shút’),  and  because  of  the  accompanying  clattering  ofconsonants, especially the stops /k/, /t/ and /d/. We may say, in fact, thatthe  onomatopoeic  effect  is  here  overdone,  resulting  in  a  sentence  whichis  so  cluttered  with  consonants  that  it  is  difficult  to  say  aloud.  This  awk-wardness, which might be successfully exploited by a writer in a differentcontext,  forces  itself  on  the  reader ’s  attention,  detracting  from  the  forceof discreet.




The lowest level of style in Figure 4.3 is the choice of graphological realisa-tions  of  a  given  syntactic  form.  For  example,  
[3]  might  have  been  divided into  two  separate  units  of  information  by  punctuation:
[14] The discreet door shut – with a click.Or  a  similar  division  might  have  been  made  by  a  comma  in  [12]
:[15]  With  a  click,  the  discreet  door  shut.

Levels  of  style105This punctuation would have made some difference to the reader’s process-ing  of  the  sentence;  [14]  in  particular  would  have  made  the  ‘click’  seem  amatter  of  importance  and  surprise  in  its  own  right,  dividing  the  reader’sattention between the two events, instead of making him see them as integ-ral parts of a whole.Graphological variation is a relatively minor and superficial part of style(see sections 7.4 –7.4.1), concerning such matters as spelling, capitalisation,hyphenation,  italicisation  and  paragraphing.  Such  matters  are  to  a  greatextent  determined  conventionally  by  syntax,  and  become  noticeably  ex-pressive only when a writer makes a graphological choice which is to somedegree  marked  or  unconventional,  such  as  a  deliberate  misspelling.  Thisis  why  graphology  was  not  given  a  separate  heading  in  our  checklist  ofstylistic features in section 3.1;


 Graphological conven-tions  are  exploited  impressionistically,  in  a  way  which  suggests  what  sortof pronunciation a reader should adopt in reading aloud. For example, thecapital  letters  of  ‘How  Do  You  Like  London?’  might  suggest  a  number  ofphonetic  factors  –  abnormal  loudness,  slow-motion  delivery,  stressing  ofevery  syllable  –  all  expressive  of  the  proverbial  Englishman’s  assumptionthat those who cannot speak his language as a native are deaf, or stupid, orboth.  The  significant  point  is  that  an  initial  capital  is  a  form  of  emphasisor highlighting in writing, and therefore can be used as a visual correlativeof  emphasis  in  speech  (see  also  section  5.4.2).


No one would claim, of course, that they constitutea  literary  tour  de  force.This,  if  anything,  strengthens  the  claim  for  the  ana-lysis;  for  one  of  the  problems  of  prose  style  (as  contrasted  with  poetry)  isthat  the  ingredients  of  effective  writing  frequently  seem  invisible  even  toan attentive reader. It is a common experience to feel that an author writeswell,  without  being  able  to  lay  one’s  finger  on  the  reasons.  Looking  at  themight-have-beens  of  stylistic  variation  is  a  way  of  laying  the  elusive  qual-ity  of  good  writing  open  to  inspection.a



as led us to focus not on a ‘mock-reality’ but ona  mode  of  experience.  It  is  not  how  things  are  that  matters,  but  how  theyseem.  The  effect  is  very  different,  however,  from  the  beginning  of  Joyce’sPortrait (see p. 23), which also presents a child’s version of reality, but in theartless style of the child itself.


This is perhaps an extreme form of the kind of thing Rothfuss is warning against; contemporary writers are more likely to try to slip in a couple of pages about a particular fantasy city when they should be revealing that information gradually over the course of a plot-driven chapter, but darn it if Tolkien isn’t an easy target when it comes to information dumps.
So: take a breath. Slow down. Your reader doesn’t need to know as much as you think they do, and certainly not now, at the very beginning of your chapter – don’t be afraid to release information slowly as your plot progresses. Let your reader piece it together as they go.
Of course, there’s no right answer to exactly how much information you should be including in your fiction, particularly early on, when everything is new, but I tend to agree with Rothfuss when he says his ‘personal philosophy is to err on the side of caution.’


Rothfuss, never one to jerk knees, recognizes his own background and the limitations that come with it. He talks about how he struggled to make Denna – a major character in The Kingkiller Chronicle and the detached, moody love interest to Kvothe, the protagonist – as engaging, interesting, and likable as he’d envisioned:
Rothfuss is able to walk the line with Denna because she’s seen through the eyes of Kvothe, who, as Rothfuss points out, is unable to see her ‘in an objective way.’ But the trade-off is that we get a sometimes warped, uncomfortable-feeling character – a woman who, if she was the main protagonist, might fall flat.
There’s no easy way to get into another person’s head but, beyond careful empathizing, writers shouldn’t be afraid to talk to people as part of their research. Characters need researching too, and if you’re able to sit down with a bunch of people, whether they be beta readers who’ll directly respond to your characters or just people with different viewpoints, you’ll be sure to learn something. Hearing people talk about their own experience of the world can be eye-opening and, if you’re writing fiction, your characters are sure to benefit.


Showing the internal logic (making it clear to a reader) is important in non-fiction too. Giving your story internal logic isn't about cutting down your options, it's about giving them meaning. Anyone can do anything when there are no rules, which means nothing anyone does is actually impressive.
This is something you could use in your own journal writing to show why the things you have done are an accomplishment now at the age of 32.

In Rothfuss’ novels, the magic system, ‘sympathy,’ is pretty much an exact science. Rothfuss lays out the components of sympathy early on, meaning his characters’ tools are plain to see. A combination of ‘Renaissance concepts of Hermetic magic’ and ‘alchemy,’ the stuff ‘Newton used to do back in the day,’ sympathy makes its limits clear to the reader, which in turn solidifies (and on some level rationalizes) the story’s world. Regarding sympathy, Rothfuss says:








How scientific is sympathy?
It's hard to get more scientific. I literally have the math for a lot of these things. I have run the numbers about how much heat it takes for this and that, and accounting for slippage, or whatever. I can look at my chalkboard here and see all of the delta calculations for how much energy it takes to boil gold. So I do the math.

Is that so important?

    Once I explain that framework to you, if my characters are clever using the framework, then you can appreciate their cleverness at a different depth, and it’s very satisfying. You cannot get that same satisfaction in a world that does not have a cohesive, understandable, and explicit system.
The reader won’t have any trouble swallowing unlikely escapes or miraculous intervention because the logic of the story’s world is so clearly presented.  

Aside from describing Denna, though, isn't Kvothe good at literally everything else?
There are brilliant people out there who are good at things right off the cuff. I want to read books full of people being awesome. You can go too far. You can become unrealistic. But I think the fear of writing someone too perfect or too cool leads to a lot of godawful fucking books. If I wanted to watch people sucking and being dumb, I would just spend all my time on Twitter



ell, when Kvothe went to the University, he was originally buddies with Lorren. He was like, "I wanna go into the Archives," and Lorren's like, "Lemme show you around." Kvothe liked it just fine, but what's the problem? A certain thing that most authors like to include in a book---tension.

Make sure to point out the tension in your own life (for journaling).

ut a book is so much more than a series of interesting chapters.


Would you say you put your finest words together for the prologue and epilogue?
Even if you're being charitable, you have to acknowledge it is kind of arty bullshit. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm not saying I don't like it, but it's a different type of writing. One of the things I'm careful of is to not let myself indulge in certain language, things that I would do just for the beauty of it. Because those things can work contrary to the story. Everything should be in service to the story. If I make the language so fancy that people keep going, "Oh wow, what a beautiful phrase," I've pulled you out of the story. So I spent a lot of time on the prologue, even after I'd written that draft, typing it up and making it work and doing the variations that bookend each book. As much as half an hour per word.


To make a character feel real: make them complex and give them things to do other than what directly relates to the main character(s) and main story line. It's helpful to not have everyone in the world revolve around the main character/story. They're doing things when the main characters are off doing something.


When starting a scene don't sit down and figure out what will happen in the scene (at least for fictional writing).

Practicing poetry helps worth WORDS, LANGUAGE, and LYRACISM and BREVITY.

Adding in some disabilities for the characters (or pointing out disabililtes in real people) helps give people realness.


Writing is one of the only hobbies which is seen as a failure if the person never publishes.

If you do the thing that you love you will never work aother day in your life is the biggest lie becuase you will ruin the thing that you love for yourself. You will then work everyday of your life becuase you won't have your hobby anymore.


I want to write a book on being a merchant in italy in 16th centuryish.

Write a novel of 50,000 words in one month. It's a good way to turn off your editor and get you going (it can remove blocks).
Begin with a monologue. (it helps to be able to get going). Interview a character or have them (a character) tell you the story. The charcter explains themselves out to you in a roughly 5 page narative.

Ask yourself: what does my character need, and what do they want, and how are those 2 things different. Then start to construct the obstacles that keep them from getting what they want. This will mamke your story character centric. A problem that happnes a lot is a character turns into an observer of an important part of the story. this will help this.

Copy the structure of a story that you like or one that is in the same genre.

A story is (simply put): A promise, progress towards that promise, and the payoff of that promise.The Progress is the bulk of your story. This on some level could be like a travel-log, which you can see on a map, like the shire to mount-doom.
Or instead of a travel-log it could be a mystery novel where the character is getting clues and that is the progress. If a story is lagging or not moving quickly enough it is often because the author is not sign-posting the progress enough. You may need more sign-posts or bigger sign-posts. What kind of progress are you going to feed the reader and then spread it out like bread crumbs.

Prime your mind with what you are going to write before you start. Think about the details of a section of the book while you do a busy-body task like doing the dishes. This will help you be able to sit down and write because you know where the story is going.

Your main character should have flaws but not annoying or repulsive ones.

Take care that your bad guy isn't evil just because he is the villan. Most villan's think they are right.

Writing Benefits
Careful writing about traumatic or uncertain events, past, present or future, appears to produce a variety of benefits, physiological and psychological. Written accounts of trauma positively influence health.
Participants are asked to describea traumatic personal eventin writing (or, in the control condition, to write about a trivial topic), during 15 to 30 minute sessions. These sessions range in frequency,from a single instance to multiple sittings,spread out over a numberof weeks. During each session, individuals are instructed to write continually for the allotted time, without regard for grammar or spelling
