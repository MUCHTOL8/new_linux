- Game

`The main global game object containing all the game play information.`

- InterShardMemory

`Object provides an interface for communicating between shards. Your script is executed separatedly on each shard, and their Memory objects are isolated from each other. In order to pass messages and data between shards, you need to use InterShardMemory instead.`
`Every shard can have its own 100 KB of data in string format that can be accessed by all other shards. A shard can write only to its own data, other shards' data is read-only.`
`This data has nothing to do with Memory contents, it's a separate data container.`

- Game.map

`A global object representing world map. Use it to navigate between rooms.`

- Game.map.visual

`Map visuals provide a way to show various visual debug info on the game map. You can use the Game.map.visual object to draw simple shapes that are visible only to you.`
`Map visuals are not stored in the database, their only purpose is to display something in your browser. All drawings will persist for one tick and will disappear if not updated. All Game.map.visual calls have no added CPU cost (their cost is natural and mostly related to simple JSON.serialize calls). However, there is a usage limit: you cannot post more than 1000 KB of serialized data.`
`All draw coordinates are measured in global game coordinates (RoomPosition).`

- Game.market

`A global object representing the in-game market. You can use this object to track resource transactions to/from your terminals, and your buy/sell orders.`
`Learn more about the market system from this article.`

- PathFinder

`Contains powerful methods for pathfinding in the game world. This module is written in fast native C++ code and supports custom navigation costs and paths which span multiple rooms.`

- RawMemory

`RawMemory object allows to implement your own memory stringifier instead of built-in serializer based on JSON.stringify. It also allows to request up to 10 MB of additional memory using asynchronous memory segments feature.`
`You can also access memory segments of other players using methods below.`

- Constants

`All the following constant names are available in the global scope:`

- ConstructionSite

`A site of a structure which is currently under construction. A construction site can be created using the 'Construct' button at the left of the game field or the Room.createConstructionSite method.`
`To build a structure on the construction site, give a worker creep some amount of energy and perform Creep.build action.`
`You can remove enemy construction sites by moving a creep on it.`

- Creep

`Creeps are your units. Creeps can move, harvest energy, construct structures, attack another creeps, and perform other actions. Each creep consists of up to 50 body parts with the following possible types:`
`Body part 	Build cost 	Effect per one body part`
`MOVE 		50 		Decreases fatigue by 2 points per tick.`
`WORK 		100 		Harvests 2 energy units from a source per tick.`
`				Harvests 1 resource unit from a mineral or a deposit per tick.`
`				Builds a structure for 5 energy units per tick.`
`				Repairs a structure for 100 hits per tick consuming 1 energy unit per tick.`
`				Dismantles a structure for 50 hits per tick returning 0.25 energy unit per tick.`
`				Upgrades a controller for 1 energy unit per tick.`
`CARRY 		50 		Can contain up to 50 resource units.`
`ATTACK 	80 		Attacks another creep/structure with 30 hits per tick in a short-ranged attack.`
`RANGED_ATTACK 	150 		Attacks another single creep/structure with 10 hits per tick in a long-range attack up to 3 squares long.`
`Attacks all hostile creeps/structures within 3 squares range with 1-4-10 hits (depending on the range).`
`HEAL 		250 		Heals self or another creep restoring 12 hits per tick in short range or 4 hits per tick at a distance.`
`CLAIM 		600 		Claims a neutral room controller.`
`				Reserves a neutral room controller for 1 tick per body part.`
`				Attacks a hostile room controller downgrading its timer by 300 ticks per body parts.`
`				Attacks a neutral room controller reservation timer by 1 tick per body parts.`
`				A creep with this body part will have a reduced life time of 600 ticks and cannot be renewed.`
`TOUGH	 	10 		No effect, just additional hit points to the creep's body. Can be boosted to resist damage.`

- Deposit 

`A rare resource deposit needed for producing commodities. Can be harvested by creeps with a WORK body part. Each harvest operation triggers a cooldown period, which becomes longer and longer over time.`
`Learn more about deposits from this article. `
`Cooldown 	0.001 * totalHarvested ^ 1.2`
`Decay 	50,000 ticks after appearing or last harvest operation`

- Flag

`A flag. Flags can be used to mark particular spots in a room. Flags are visible to their owners only. You cannot have more than 10,000 flags.`

- Mineral

`A mineral deposit. Can be harvested by creeps with a WORK body part using the extractor structure. Learn more about minerals from this article.`
`Regeneration amount 	DENSITY_LOW: 15,000`
`			DENSITY_MODERATE: 35,000`
`			DENSITY_HIGH: 70,000`
`			DENSITY_ULTRA: 100,000`

- Nuke

`A nuke landing position. This object cannot be removed or modified. You can find incoming nukes in the room using the FIND_NUKES constant.`
`Landing time 	50,000 ticks`
`Effect 	All creeps, construction sites and dropped resources in the room are removed immediately, even inside ramparts. Damage to structures:`
`		10,000,000 hits at the landing position;`
`		5,000,000 hits to all structures in 5x5 area.`
`		Note that you can stack multiple nukes from different rooms at the same target position to increase damage.`

`		Nuke landing does not generate tombstones and ruins, and destroys all existing tombstones and ruins in the room`

`		If the room is in safe mode, then the safe mode is cancelled immediately, and the safe mode cooldown is reset to 0.`

`		The room controller is hit by triggering upgradeBlocked period, which means it is unavailable to activate safe mode again within the next 200 ticks.`

- OwnedStructure

`The base prototype for a structure that has an owner. Such structures can be found using FIND_MY_STRUCTURES and FIND_HOSTILE_STRUCTURES constants.`

- PathFinder.CostMatrix

`Container for custom navigation cost data. By default PathFinder will only consider terrain data (plain, swamp, wall) â€” if you need to route around obstacles such as buildings or creeps you must put them into a CostMatrix. Generally you will create your CostMatrix from within roomCallback. If a non-0 value is found in a room's CostMatrix then that value will be used instead of the default terrain cost. You should avoid using large values in your CostMatrix and terrain cost flags. For example, running PathFinder.search with { plainCost: 1, swampCost: 5 } is faster than running it with {plainCost: 2, swampCost: 10 } even though your paths will be the same.`

- PowerCreep

`Power Creeps are immortal "heroes" that are tied to your account and can be respawned in any PowerSpawn after death. You can upgrade their abilities ("powers") up to your account Global Power Level (see Game.gpl).`
`Time to live 	5,000`
`Hits 		1,000 per level`
`Capacity 	100 per level`
`Full list of available powers in a list.`

- Resource

`A dropped piece of resource. It will decay after a while if not picked up. Dropped resource pile decays for ceil(amount/1000) units per tick. `

- Room

`An object representing the room in which your units and structures are in. It can be used to look around, find paths, etc. Every RoomObject in the room contains its linked Room instance in the room property.`

- Room.Terrain

`An object which provides fast access to room terrain data. These objects can be constructed for any room in the world even if you have no access to it.`

`Technically every Room.Terrain object is a very lightweight adapter to underlying static terrain buffers with corresponding minimal accessors.`

- RoomObject

`Any object with a position in a room. Almost all game objects prototypes are derived from RoomObject.`

- RoomPosition

`An object representing the specified position in the room. Every RoomObject in the room contains RoomPosition as the pos property. The position object of a custom location can be obtained using the Room.getPositionAt method or using the constructor.`

- RoomVisual

`Room visuals provide a way to show various visual debug info in game rooms. You can use the RoomVisual object to draw simple shapes that are visible only to you. Every existing Room object already contains the visual property, but you also can create new RoomVisual objects for any room (even without visibility) using the constructor.`

`Room visuals are not stored in the database, their only purpose is to display something in your browser. All drawings will persist for one tick and will disappear if not updated. All RoomVisual API calls have no added CPU cost (their cost is natural and mostly related to simple JSON.serialize calls). However, there is a usage limit: you cannot post more than 500 KB of serialized data per one room (see getSize method).`

`All draw coordinates are measured in game coordinates and centered to tile centers, i.e. (10,10) will point to the center of the creep at x:10; y:10 position. Fractional coordinates are allowed.`

- Ruin

`A destroyed structure. This is a walkable object.`
`Decay 		500 ticks except some special cases`

- Source

`An energy source object. Can be harvested by creeps with a WORK body part.`
`Energy amount 		4000 in center rooms`
`			3000 in an owned or reserved room`
`			1500 in an unreserved room`
`Energy regeneration 	Every 300 game ticks`

- Store

`An object that can contain resources in its cargo.`

`There are two types of stores in the game: general purpose stores and limited stores.`

`    General purpose stores can contain any resource within its capacity (e.g. creeps, containers, storages, terminals).`

`    Limited stores can contain only a few types of resources needed for that particular object (e.g. spawns, extensions, labs, nukers).`

`The Store prototype is the same for both types of stores, but they have different behavior depending on the resource argument in its methods.`

`You can get specific resources from the store by addressing them as object properties:`

`console.log(creep.store[RESOURCE_ENERGY]);`

- Structure

`The base prototype object of all structures.`

`Effect 	Blocks attack, rangedAttack, rangedMassAttack, dismantle, heal, rangedHeal, attackController, and withdraw methods of all hostile creeps in the room, plus enableRoom and usePower methods of hostile Power Creeps. Only one room can be in safe mode at the same time.`
`When safe mode is active, all hostile creeps become visually transparent and passable - your creeps can move through them freely (but not vice versa).`
`Duration 	20,000 ticks`

- StructureInvaderCore

`This NPC structure is a control center of NPC Strongholds, and also rules all invaders in the sector. It spawns NPC defenders of the stronghold, refill towers, repairs structures. While it's alive, it will spawn invaders in all rooms in the same sector. It also contains some valuable resources inside, which you can loot from its ruin if you destroy the structure.`

`An Invader Core has two lifetime stages: deploy stage and active stage. When it appears in a random room in the sector, it has ticksToDeploy property, public ramparts around it, and doesn't perform any actions. While in this stage it's invulnerable to attacks (has EFFECT_INVULNERABILITY enabled). When the ticksToDeploy timer is over, it spawns structures around it and starts spawning creeps, becomes vulnerable, and receives EFFECT_COLLAPSE_TIMER which will remove the stronghold when this timer is over.`

`An active Invader Core spawns level-0 Invader Cores in neutral neighbor rooms inside the sector. These lesser Invader Cores are spawned near the room controller and don't perform any activity except reserving/attacking the controller. One Invader Core can spawn up to 42 lesser Cores during its lifetime.`
