> The principles of math.


Math is: describing something as a set of axioms (which are: elements and the relationships that exist between the elements), and using those axioms to prove a theorem (a theoy, if these axioms are true then this 'thing' is also true), and using the axioms along with theorems that have been proven and are generally accepted, by prominent mathematicians in the math community, as being useful (or "interesting" to use their own words). 
Mathematics is not merely a tool to symbolize quantities. Expressions which show the relationships of things are dynamic mathematics. It shoes both the quantities and qualities of a thing (possibily the "quality" of a number).
When learning any area of math it is advisable to first put before yourself a list of the well known and useful axioms and theorems used in that area of math that you can use when working to understand any problem in that mathematical category (linear algebra, trigonometry, etc).

Here is a description of each:
1. Algebra
Algebra is a broad division of mathematics. Algebra uses variable (letters) and other mathematical symbols to represent numbers in equations. It is basically completing and balancing the parts on the two sides of the equation.

It can be considered as the unifying type of all the fields in mathematics. Algebra’s concept first appeared in an Arabic book which has a title that roughly translates to ‘the science of restoring of what is missing and equating like with like.’ The word came from Arabic which means completion of missing parts.

2. Geometry
The word geometry comes from the Greek words ‘gē’ meaning ‘Earth’ and ‘metria’ meaning ‘measure’. It is the mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, positions, and properties of space.

It also studies the relationship and properties of set of points. It involves the lines, angles, shapes, and spaces formed.

3. Trigonometry
Trigonometry comes from the Greek words ‘trigōnon’ which means ‘triangle’ and ‘metria’ which means ‘measure’. As its name suggests, it is the study the sides and angles, and their relationship in triangles.

Some real life applications of trigonometry are navigation, astronomy, oceanography, and architecture.

4. Calculus
Calculus is an advanced branch of mathematics concerned in finding and properties of derivatives and integrals of functions. It is the study of rates of change and deals with finding lengths, areas, and volumes.

Calculus is used by engineers, economists, scientists such as space scientists, etc.

5. Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics and a subfield of algebra. It studies lines, planes, and subspaces. It is concerned with vector spaces and linear mappings between those spaces.

This branch of mathematics is used in chemistry, cryptography, geometry, linear programming, sociology, the Fibonacci numbers, etc.

6. Combinatorics
The name combinatorics might sound complicated, but combinatorics is just different methods of counting. The word was derived from the word ‘combination’, therefore in is used to combine objects following rules of arranging those objects.

There are two combinatorics categories: enumeration and graph theory. Permutation, an arrangement where order matters, is often used in both of the categories.

7. Differential Equations
As the name suggest, differential equations are not really a branch of mathematics, rather a type of equation. It is any equation that contains either ordinary derivatives or partial derivatives.

The equations define the relationship between the function, which represents physical quantities, and the derivatives, which represents the rates of change.

8. Real Analysis
Real analysis is also called the theory of functions of a real variable. It is concerned with the axioms dealing with real numbers and real-valued functions of a real-variable.

It is pure mathematics, and is good for people who like plane geometry and proving.

9. Complex Analysis
Complex analysis is also called the theory of functions of a complex variable. It deals with complex numbers and their derivatives, manipulation, and other properties. Complex analysis is applied in electrical engineering, when launching satellite, etc.

10. Abstract Algebra
Sometimes called modern algebra, abstract algebra is an advanced field in algebra concerning the extension of algebraic concepts such as real number systems, complex numbers, matrices, and vector spaces.

One application of abstract algebra is cryptography; elliptic curve cryptography involves a lot of algebraic number theory and the likes.

11. Topology
Topology is a type of geometry developed in the 19th century. Its name’s Greek origin, which is ‘topos’, means place. Unlike the other types of geometry, it is not concerned with the exact dimensions, shapes, and sizes of a region.

It studies the physical space a surface unaffected by distortion contiguity, order, and position. Topology is applied in the study of the structure of the universe and in designing robots.

12. Number Theory
Number theory, or higher arithmetic, is the study of positive integers, their relationships, and properties. It is sometimes referred to as “The Queen of Mathematics” because of its foundational function in the subject.

13. Logic
Logic is the discipline in mathematics that studies formal languages, formal reasoning, the nature of mathematical proof, probability of mathematical statements, computability, and other aspects of the foundations of mathematics.

It aims to eliminate any confusion that can be caused by the vagueness of the natural language.

14. Probability
Probability is the branch of mathematics calculating the chances of some things to take place based on the number of the possible cases to the whole number of cases possible. Numbers from 0-1 are used to express the chances of something to occur.

0 means it can never happen and 1 means it will always happen. Real-life applications are in gambling, lottery, sports analysis, games, weather forecasting, etc. Even the chance of an earthquake or a volcano erupting are given a probability.

15. Statistics
Statistics are the collection, analysis, measurement, interpretation, presentation and summarization of data. Statistics is used in many fields such as business analytics, demography, epidemiology, population ecology, etc.

16. Game Theory
Game theory is a branch of mathematics which also involves psychology, economics, contract theory, and sociology. It analyses strategies for dealing with competitive strategies where the outcome also depends on other actions of other partaker in the activity.

It is applied in business, wars, political sciences, biology, philosophy, etc.

17. Functional Analysis
Functional analysis is under the field of mathematical analysis. Its foundation is the study of vector spaces that has limit-related structure such as topology, inner product, norm, etc.

It was developed through the study of functions and the formulation of properties of transformation. Functional analysis is found to be useful for differential and integral equations.

18. Algebraic Geometry
Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic expressions to describe geometric properties of structures.

19. Differential Geometry
Differential geometry is a field in mathematics that utilizes different mathematical techniques (differential calculus, integral calculus, linear algebra, and multilinear algebra) to study geometric problems.

It is used in different studies of electromagnetism, econometrics, geometric modeling, digital signal processing in engineering, study of geological structures.

20. Dynamic systems (Chaos Theory)
Dynamical Systems (also referred to as chaos theory) is a mathematical concept where the relationship of a point in space to time is described a fixed set of rules. This concept explains the swinging of a clock pendulum, flow of water in a pipe, number of fish in a lake during springtime, etc.

21. Numerical Analysis
Numerical analysis is an area in mathematics which develops, evaluates, and applies algorithms for numerically solving problems that occur throughout the natural sciences, social sciences, medicine, engineering and business.

22. Set Theory
Set theory is a discipline in mathematics that is concerned with the formal properties of a well-defined set of objects as units (regardless of the nature of each element) and using set as a means of expression of other branch of math.

Every object in the set has something similar or follows a rule, and they are called the elements.

23. Category Theory
Category theory is a formalism that is used for representing and manipulating concepts and symbolic representations of domains. Here, the collection of objects and of arrows formalizes mathematical structure.

24. Model Theory
Model theory in mathematics is the study of different structures from a logical standpoint. It involves interpretation of formal and natural languages and the kinds of classifications they can make.

25. Mathematical Physics
Mathematics as mentioned earlier is used in many different other fields. Physics is just one of them. Mathematical physics refers to the mathematical methods applied for different studies and development in physics.

26. Discrete Mathematics
Unlike the many other ones mentioned above, discrete mathematics is not a branch, but a description of the study of mathematical structures that are discrete rather than continuous.

Discrete objects, in simple languages, are the countable objects such as integers. Therefore, discrete mathematics does not include calculus and analysis.


Add more description to each of the areas above (especially since I was unable to add the their accompanying pictures).



A1. A result or observation that we think is true is called a Hypothesis or Conjecture. 
A2. Once we have proven it, we call it a Theorem. 
A3. Once we have proven a theorem, we can use it to prove other, more complicated results – thus building up a growing network of mathematical theorems.

B1. One interesting question is where to start from. How do you prove the first theorem, if you don’t know anything yet?
B2. Unfortunately you can’t prove something using nothing. You need at least a few building blocks to start with, and these are called Axioms.

C1. Axioms are things ASSUMED to be true.
C2. They are things so fundamental and obvious that all parties agree that they can't be DISPROVEN.
C3. You would say that axioms are things we know to be true. 
C4. In reality axioms are things we believe very strongly to be true.
C5. Mathematicians assume that axioms are true without being able to prove them.
D1. However this is not as problematic as it may seem, because axioms are either definitions or clearly obvious, and there are only very few axioms. 

E1. Every area of mathematics has its own set of basic axioms.

F1. Proofs are what make mathematics different from all other sciences, because once we have proven something we are absolutely certain that it is and will always be true. 
F2. It is not just a theory that fits our observations and may be replaced by a better theory in the future.

G1. Induction is a technique used to prove things, such as mathematical hypothesis.

H1. Mathematics is not about choosing the right set of axioms, but about developing a framework from these starting points. 
H2. If you start with different axioms, you will get a different kind of mathematics, but the logical arguments will be the same.

I1. Axioms are important to get right, because all of mathematics rests on them. 
I2. If there are too few axioms, you can prove very little and mathematics would not be very interesting. 
I3. If there are too many axioms, you can prove almost anything, and mathematics would also not be interesting. 
I4. You also can’t have axioms contradicting each other.

J1. When mathematicians have proven a theorem, they publish it for other mathematicians to check. 
J2. Sometimes they find a mistake in the logical argument, and sometimes a mistake is not found until many years later. 
J3. However, in principle, it is always possible to break a proof down into the basic axioms.

Induction can be compared to falling dominoes: whenever one domino falls, the next one also falls. The first step, proving that S(1) is true, starts the infinite chain reaction.

The first step is often overlooked, because it is so simple. In fact it is very important and the entire induction chain depends on it.

Some theorems can’t quite be proved using induction – we have to use a slightly modified version called Strong Induction.

It turns out that the principle of weak induction and the principle of strong induction are equivalent: each implies the other one. 
They are also both equivalent to a third theorem, the Well-Ordering Principle.

Proof by Contradiction is another important proof technique.
If we want to prove a statement S, we assume that S wasn’t true. 
Using this assumption we try to deduce a false result, such as 0 = 1. 
If all our steps were correct and the result is false, our initial assumption must have been wrong. 
Our initial assumption was that S isn’t true, which means that S actually is true.

Kurt Gödel in 1931. He proved that in any (sufficiently complex) mathematical system with a certain set of axioms, you can find some statements which can neither be proved nor disproved using those axioms. It is also not possible to prove that a certain set of axioms is consistent, using nothing but the axioms itself.

del’s discovery is based on the fact that a set of axioms can’t be used to say anything about itself, such as whether it is consistent. Problems with self-reference can not only be found in mathematics but also in language. Here is the Liar Paradox:

“This sentence is false.”

The sentence above tries to say something about itself. If it is true then the sentence tells us that it is false. If it is false, then the sentence tells us that it is not false, i.e. that it is true. In effect, the sentence is neither true nor false.

When first published, Gödel’s theorems were deeply troubling to many mathematicians. When setting out to prove an observation, you don’t know whether a proof exists – the result might be true but unprovable. Today we know that incompleteness is a fundamental part of logic.

Surprisingly, it is possible to prove that certain statements are unprovable. One example is the Continuum Hypothesis, which is about the size of infinite sets.

Kurt Godel's insights into the foundations of logic were the most profound ones since the development of proof by the ancient Greeks.

Deductive reason about nature is all based on observed “regularities”. Those regularities are those of association, where one thing is always observed in the company of another, or the observation of e.g. mathematical“structure”. There is an unspoken assumption that underlies it – that there exists a correspondance between any sort of regularity and some underlying truth that can thereby be used as “input” to construct a logical argument that will lead to true conclusions that extrapolate this regularity. This process is known as inductive reasoning, or inference. We observe a regularity in a series of events in nature, and imagine that this regularity will continue, that it istrue. We even give names to some of the regularities (such as “The Law of Universal Gravitation”) and proceed to reason with them as if they are fundamental truths. However, induction (as a process leading from observation to absolute truths about the real world) cannot itself be deductively proven to be valid. Inference (in Hume’s time) could only be assumed to be valid; it was an axiom. An inconsistent axiom.  Inference (induction) from partial data not infrequently leads to conclusions that inference based on more data later contradicts, so we should correctly infer beyond any doubt that conclusions drawn from inference can be doubted and are not truth in the sense that conclusions drawn from deductive reasoning from a set of “self-evident” premises are. Consequently (according to Hume) one could never reason to conclusions concerning the real world and be certain that they are true. Reason itself was not a tool that could in principle lead to true knowledge!

Mathematics is developed by never knowing, or caring, if the premises, the axioms of any particular mathematical theory, are really “true”. They are simply defined to be true, end of story. Afterwards, the laws of thought and process of deductive reason are all about consistency and inconsistency, completeness or incompleteness, the mechanical analysis of a system of relationships that permit the symbolic formulation of assertions according to rules and the consistent association of contingent true, false, or undecideable values to each assertion in the set of all possible assertions in the theory, including the original axioms themselves (which might be self-contradictory, as would be the case if we start with both of the axioms: A is true; and, A is false (for any A), or self-referential, as in “This statement is false.”). Pure mathematics is simultaneously beautiful and devoid of meaning because there is no logically necessary connection between the systems of symbols being consistently manipulated and anything at all. The “universe” of mathematical discourse in a theory (the set of all possible assertions of that theory) is dis-joint from the singular existential Universe of our experience, barring a set of axioms that form a bridge between the two. Mathematics is a peculiar form of knowledge, because it isn’t knowledge of anything at all, it is a knowledge of contingent relationships between symbols, the essence of “abstract” knowledge. This intangible quality of mathematics is so elusive that it can easily trick usinto granting it “mystical” properties, and indeed at various times in history mathematics has been something of a religion, one founded on the religious belief that one or another set of axioms, say those concerning numbers or geometry were fundamental truths and related in some way to the metaphysical basis for all things, beyond all doubt or variation.

Some base axoim systems:
Euclid and Hilbert: Geometery
Peano: Arithmetic and Number Theory
Cauchy, Bolzano, and Weierstrass: Approximations?




Mathematical theories usually start with the attempts to solve some concrete problems. Axioms come later, as some common and useful patterns in reasoning and computations, and they are mostly a matter of technical convenience rather than some profound revelations, as they are so often portrayed.
Unfortunately all too often axioms and definitions are presented first, then some impressively looking theorems are presented, and then examples and applications are shown as afterthoughts to illustrate some “general theory.” This abstract and formal approach makes mathematics much more difficult and less understandable than it has ho be.


You could go off, invent your own axioms from scratch and prove tricky, technical theorems using these axioms. Nobody would care. You wouldn’t be able to publish anything and nobody would read your papers even if you could. Why should they? Your results would not relate to any existing work in the mathematical world. The axioms you use have to be something special for your work to matter.
It’s hard to pin down exactly what “interesting” means in this context. It’s a fuzzy, social, human notion. There are some aspects of axiomatic systems that clear affect whether they’re interesting—simplicity and elegance—but it’s also a function of purely social factors like the aesthetic and mathematical preferences of other working mathematicians. Learning math at a research level involves not only grasping the technical content but also building up an intuition for what makes math interesting.
Consider the small group of people who reject the notion of infinity (“ultrafinitists”). They come up with their own axiomatic foundations for math that are entirely finite and use those axioms to derive non-trivial results. These are not cranks, they are doing real math. Nobody else cares. Allowing infinity leads to a cleaner system with fewer edge cases and powers a lot of common, incredibly useful and elegant mathematical results. Ultrafinitists’ work is so far removed from “normal” math that it simply isn’t relevant and a lot of people do see them as cranks
The other sense in which we trust axioms is that we believe they can be applied to understand the real world. This can be something as fancy as using general relativity to make GPS more accurate or something as simple as calculating how much you owe at a restaurant. Any time you treat math as anything more than an abstract game, you’re trusting that the axioms and results are meaningful outside of pure mathematics. Pure mathematics can give you confidence in theorems and results—if the mathematical reasoning is sound, the theorem is a true result of the axioms. But, since we had to assume the axioms to do the math, the axioms themselves have to be justified in some other way.
Why simple axioms are justified to model the world is a thorny philosophical question that comes down to The Problem of Induction
. Happily, if we sweep the philosophical issues under the rug, there’s an easy pragmatic answer: we trust common mathematical axioms to model the world because they work. If we can build a rocket and send somebody to the moon based on a small set of axioms then those axioms must have given us a pretty damn accurate model of of the world!
Of course, we didn’t start trusting axioms in the real world for the first time during the space race—we’ve been applying mathematical ideas to questions outside of math as long as math has existed. Even something as simple as counting physical objects places trust in a purely abstract axiomatic system. If I have five rocks and you give me one rock and then I give another rock away, I have five again. For a thought that feels completely trivial, there is actually some sophisticated abstraction here: we map a complex physical system (rocks that are all subtly different, have different weights, can be moved around in 3D space and interact with the rest of the physical world) to a simple abstraction, do some algebraic operations on the abstraction and map the result back to the physical system. And we end up with not only a strong understanding of that particular situation but also a way to generalize to other numbers of rocks or to numbers of other physical things.



   Usually an axiomatic system does not stand alone, but other systems are also assumed to hold.  For example, we will assume:
     1.   the real number system,
     2.   some set theory,
     3.   Aristotelian logic system, and
     4.   the English language.
     We will not develop any of these but use what we need from them.      One of the pitfalls of working with a deductive system is too great a familiarity with the subject matter of the system.  We need to be careful with what we are assuming to be true and with saying something is obvious while writing a proof. We need to take extreme care that we do not make an additional assumption outside the system being studied. A common error in the writing of proofs in geometry is to base the proof on a picture. A picture may be misleading, either by not covering all possibilities, or by reflecting our unconscious bias as to what is correct.




In mathematics, axiomatization is the process of taking a body of knowledge and working backwards towards its axioms.[8] It is the formulation of a system of statements (i.e. axioms) that relate a number of primitive terms — in order that a consistent body of propositions may be derived deductively from these statements. Thereafter, the proof of any proposition should be, in principle, traceable back to these axioms. 










Below are some of the basic axioims used to define natural numbers, called Peano Axioms, named after the Italian mathematician Guiseppe Peano (1858-1932).


Fundamental Axioms of nmbers.

- Axiom 1. Commutative axiom of addition

`For any two numbers a and b,`
`a + b = b + a`
`Any 2 numbers are commutative (interchangable) when adding.`

- Axiom 2. Associative Axiom of Addition

`For any numbers a, b, and c,`
`(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`
`The order of adding numbers won't change their sum.`

- Axiom 3. Commutative Axiom of Multipliation

`For any two numbers a and b,`
`a * b = b * a, also written as, ab = ba`
`Same as Axiom 1 but for multiplication`

- Axiom 4. Associative axiom of multiplication.

`For any three numbers a, b, and c,`
`(ab)c = a(bc)`
`Same as Axiom 2 but for multiplication`

- Axiom 5. 0 is a unique number

`There is a unique number 0 such that:`
`a) 0 + a = a for every number a,`
`b) 0 * a = 0 for every number a,`
`c) if ab = 0 then eitehr a = 0 or b = 0 or both are 0.`
`lists the properties of zero, which give proof of it's actual existence.' 

- Axiom 6. 1 is a unique number

`Thre is a uniqe number 1 such that:`
`1 * a = a`
`for every number a.`
`If one is to justify the operations with 1 by appealing to axioms rather than to physical meaning, there must be a statement which tells us just what these properties are.`

- Axiom 7. If a and b are any two numbers, there is a unique number x such that:

`a = b + x`
`the quantity x is what we usually denote by a - b.`
`shows that subtraction is the inverse of addition`
