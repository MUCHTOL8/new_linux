Tips for making better decisions:

1. Worse Case Consequence Analysis (WCCA). Analyse potential consequences before making a decision

2. Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM). Weigh the various decisions and see which one is better

True wealth is authored by three fundamental F’s:

    Family (relationships). Wealth is strong spirited familial relationships with people
    Fitness (health). Fitness includes health, vibrancy, passion, and boundless energy 
    Freedom (choice). Freedom is the ability to pursue your dreams and do what you love


Your roadmap. The roadmap is the guiding force behind the decisions you make 
Your vehicle. Your vehicle is you. No one can drive you to your financial destination
Your roads. Roads are the financial pathways that lead to wealth.
Your speed. Speed refers to execution or your ability to go from idea to implementation

The Fastlane mindset:

    Debt perception:  Debt is useful as it allows one to grow their system
    Time perception: Time is far more important than money
    Education perception. Learning is important for growth
    Money perception. Money is everywhere. It reflects the value you create
    Wealth perception. Build business systems for cash flow and asset valuation

The Fastlane wealth equation looks like this:

Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value

Asset Value = (Net Profit) X (Industry Multiplier)

The Real Law of Wealth

The law of effection: The more lives you affect in an entity you control, in scale or in magnitude, the richer you become.
    “To exploit the Law of Effection, your business needs to make an impact of either scale or magnitude, or both. Within our Fastlane wealth equation, “scale” and “magnitude” are implicit to our “net profit” variable. NET PROFIT = Units Sold (Scale) X Unit Profit (Magnitude)”

The Five Faslane Business Seedlings

1    Rental systems. Real estate is an example of a rental system that produces a recurring monthly income
2    Computer/software systems. The internet and software programs have created more millionaires than any other system in history
3    Content systems. Content systems are systems of information. They include books, blogs, and social networks
4    Distribution systems. These are systems that move products to the masses. An example is Amazon
5    Human resource systems. Systems that are run by people. Sometimes they can work in conjunction with other systems

You can’t pay yourself first if you don’t own yourself.  To own yourself, create a corporation that divorces you from the act of business.

The recommended Fastlane business entity is either a C corp or an S corp.



The Five Fastlane Commandments (NECST)

    The commandment of need. Businesses satisfy the needs of people. Don’t chase money. Rather, look at how your business will help other people
    The commandment of entry.  As entry barriers to a business fall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that field subsequently strengthens. To overcome weak entry, you need exceptionalism
    The commandment of control.  Play in an organization that you control or you will be at the mercy of someone else
    The commandment of scale. Increase scale and magnitude in your business
    The commandment of time. Your business should detach you from your time


Execution divides winners from losers. Execution is a process. Ideas are events.
